# Grape

**Grape** is a syntax-aware `grep`-like utility for Clojure code.

The API is very WIP for now.

## Usage

### CLI

FIXME
```
lein run <pattern> <file> [<file> ...]
```

### Library

```clojure
(require '[grape.core :as g])

;; Find all occurrences of map called with three arguments
(g/find-codes (slurp "myfile.clj") "(map $ $ $)")
```

### Wildcards

* `$`: any expression. This matches e.g. `42` and `(defn f [] 42)`.
