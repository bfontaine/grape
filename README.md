# Grape
**Grape** is a syntax-aware `grep`-like utility for Clojure code. It allows one
to search for code patterns using Clojure structures.

NOTE: the API is very WIP for now.

## Command-Line Usage

FIXME
```
lein run [-r|--recursive] <pattern> <file> [<file> ...]
```

## Library

```clojure
(require '[grape.core :as g])

;; Find all occurrences of map called with three arguments
(let [pattern (g/pattern "(map $ $ $)")]
  (g/find-codes (slurp "myfile.clj") pattern))

;; Find all occurrences of (condp = ...)
(let [pattern (g/pattern "(condp = $&)")]
  (g/find-codes (slurp "myfile.clj") pattern))
```

## Patterns
A pattern is any valid Clojure expression. It can contain some special symbols
that are interpreted as wildcards.

Comments, whitespaces, and discard reader macros (`#_`) are ignored when
matching: `[43]` doesn't match `#_ [43] 42` nor `42 ;; [43]` but it matches
`[ 43 ]`.

### Wildcards
* `$`: any expression. `$` matches `42` and `(defn f [] 42)`. `(map $)` matches
       `(map inc)` but not `(map inc [1 2 3])`.
* `$&`: any number of expressions, including zero. `(f $&)` matches `(f)`,
        `(f 1)`, `(f 1 2)`, etc. There can be only one `$&` per sequence of
        expressions (contiguous `$&`s are equivalent to one `$&`).

Wildcards can be combined: `#{$ $&}` matches a set with at least one element.
