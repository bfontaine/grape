## Roadmap to 1.0.0

- [x] Show filenames when run on multiple files
- [x] Add an option not to show them
- [ ] Prepend the output with line numbers
- [ ] Add an option not to show them
- [ ] Add an option to show only the first line (easier copy/pasting)
- [ ] Maybe add an option to change how whitespaces are shown â€“ original vs. not indented vs. inline.
- [ ] Add unit tests for everything in `grape.cli`
