## Roadmap to 1.0.0

- [ ] Add an option to show only the first line (easier copy/pasting)
- [ ] Maybe add an option to change how whitespaces are shown â€“ original vs. not indented vs. inline.
- [ ] Maybe add an option to respect the (non-)indentation while showing lines, e.g.:

      src/myfile.clj:123:
        (map inc xs)
      src/myfile.clj:127:
        (map dec xs)
      src/myfile.clj:253:
        (map identity xs)
      src/myfile2.clj:102:
        (map f xs)

- [ ] Maybe add a newline when showing filenames:

      src/myfile.clj:
        (map inc xs)
                            <-- here
      src/myfile2.clj:
        (map dec xs)

- [ ] Add unit tests for everything in `grape.cli`
