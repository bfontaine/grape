## Roadmap to 1.0.0

- [ ] `ack`-like output by default: show line numbers and filenames (if run on multiple files). Add options to change
      that behavior:
     - [ ] Show filenames when run on multiple files
     - [ ] Add an option not to show them
     - [ ] Prepend the output with line numbers
     - [ ] Add an option not to show them
     - [ ] Add an option to show only the first line (easier copy/pasting)
- [ ] Maybe add an option to change how whitespaces are shown â€“ original vs. not indented vs. inline.
- [ ] Add unit tests for everything in `grape.cli`
